This course from [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru) prepares you for the [AWS Certified Alexa Skill Builder – Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-alexa-skill-builder-specialty/) certification exam and also teaches you how to design and build engaging voice experiences for [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) using [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/).

## Getting Started

The code for the Adventure Guru Alexa skill is broken out by lecture. For example, the Connecting Lambda to DynamoDB

* **lambda_function.zip** - The Lambda function deployment package. If this file is not present, use the deployment package from the previous chapter.
* **en-US.json** - The language model, which can be uploaded using the JSON Editor on the Alexa Developer Console.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed locally for skill development.

* **Python** - The Adventure Guru skill is authored in Python.
* **Visual Studio Code** - The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used for development. 
* **Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) SDK for Python** - The Software Development Kit (SDK) that makes it easy to author skills in Python.
* **Alexa Skills Kit Command Line Interface (ASK CLI)** - The Alexa Skills Kit Command Line Interface (ASK CLI) is a tool used to manage Alexa skills from the command line.
